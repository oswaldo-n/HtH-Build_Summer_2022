# Why are you interested in this Dataset ?

Netflix is one of the most popular media and video streaming platforms. They have over 8000 movies or tv shows available on their platform, as of mid-2021, they have over 200M Subscribers globally. Though as a past user, I have always been interested in their movies but there seems to be less movie than shows nowadays. I seek to formulate this data with python to output answers of such questions.
